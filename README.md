## Control Flow

### Primary User Journey

1. **Initial Interaction**
   - User lands on HomePage
   - Navigates to AI chat interface

2. **Medical Need Assessment**
   - User describes symptoms or requirements via chat
   - Gemini AI processes and extracts medical information
   - System identifies appropriate treatment category

3. **Clinic Recommendation**
   - Based on treatment type, location preferences
   - Clinics sorted by rating, availability, or distance
   - Detailed clinic information presented

4. **Appointment Booking**
   - Interactive calendar displays real-time availability
   - Time slot selection based on clinic schedules
   - User information collection and verification
   - Appointment confirmation and notification

5. **Post-Booking**
   - Email confirmation with credentials
   - Access to patient dashboard for appointment management

## Data Flow

1. **User Input → AI Processing → Clinic Filtering**
   - Natural language input analyzed by Gemini AI
   - Medical information extraction categorizes needs
   - Firestore queried for matching specialists

2. **Booking Information → Firebase → Email Notification**
   - Form data saved to Firestore
   - Triggers cloud function for email delivery
   - Generates user credentials if needed

3. **Appointment Data → Doctor Dashboard**
   - Real-time updates to appointment calendar
   - Physician notification system

## Architecture Patterns

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Encapsulated external integrations
- **Middleware Approach**: Enhanced state management
- **Lazy Loading**: Performance optimization
- **Immutable State Updates**: Using Immer with Zustand

## Potential Improvements

   - Unit tests for service functions
   - Integration tests for key user flows

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Further component code-splitting
   - Optimize Firebase queries
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

6. **UX/UI Refinement**
   - Standardize component styling
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add accessibility features

## Deployment Architecture

- Firebase hosting for web application
- Firebase Functions for serverless backend
- Firestore for real-time database
